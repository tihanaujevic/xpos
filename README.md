This project implements a part-of-speech (POS) tagging system trained on the hr500k dataset using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model. The hr500k dataset is a Croatian language resource that provides extensive annotated linguistic data, and this project aims to leverage it for high-accuracy POS tagging.
